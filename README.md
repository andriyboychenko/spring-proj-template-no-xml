# Spring Project Template (annotation based)

This project template is exactly the same as [this one](https://github.com/andriyboychenko/spring-proj-template), but instead of XML configurations uses annotations

* Spring MVC with REST service
* Hibernate HSQL database connection
* Internationalization based on the database MessageSource
* Dependency Injection
* EJB Startup Bean

To run this application, install Jboss AS 7.1.1 and modify deploy-script.bat if necessary.
